## Features

- âœ… Basic CHIP-8 emulation (most instructions implemented)
- âœ… Graphics rendering with SDL2
- âœ… Keyboard input support (mapped to CHIP-8 keypad)
- ðŸš§ No sound yet
- ðŸš§ No ROM file picker (manual ROM selection required)
- ðŸš§ No Windows support yet

## Building

### Requirements
- C++17 compiler
- SDL2

### Example build command (Linux)
```bash
g++ main.cpp chip8.cpp display.cpp -o chip8 -lSDL2
```

## Controls
The CHIP-8 keypad is mapped like this:
1 2 3 C      â†’      1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D      â†’      Q W E R
7 8 9 E      â†’      A S D F
A 0 B F      â†’      Z X C V

## Usage
For now, the ROM path must be hardcoded or passed directly in code.
Execution from terminal after build:
```bash
./chip8 <path_to_rom>
```
